# API---rain-alert-educational-project
This Project was from the python course that I've seen in udemey python Course 

https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

*Notice* :
I edit this code to a sample that you can add your latitude and your phone number to receive rain alert. 
also for privacy; you have to check API endpoints websites and get your API keys. also it's free.
